# Women's Well-Being

## Selected topic
What aspects of life most impact women's well-being worldwide?


## Reason why we selected our topic 
As women, we care about women's well-being and strive to figure out what aspects of life most impact if women live long and happy lives.

## Description of our source of data
"LivWell is a global longitudinal database which provides a range of key indicators related to womenâ€™s socioeconomic status, health and well-being, access to basic services, and demographic outcomes.
